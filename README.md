## Context
The provided Bash script is designed to manage records in an F5 load balancer data group using the F5 REST API. The script includes functions to:
- Add a record with an IP and associated value.
- Delete a record by its IP.

## Observed Issues
1. **Improper JSON Structure**:
   - The `curl` command in the script doesn't align with the expected JSON payload for F5 APIs.
   - Instead of properly structured JSON, query parameters are embedded in the URL (`?options=records%20add`).

2. **Credential Management**:
   - Username and password are hardcoded in the script, posing a security risk.

3. **Inefficient Use of `eval`**:
   - The script uses `eval` to execute the `curl` command, which is unnecessary and potentially insecure.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The script lacks robust error handling, making it difficult to identify and fix issues if the API call fails.

5. **Code Readability**:
   - There are some typos in comments, and the formatting could be improved for clarity.

## Suggested Fixes
### 1. Correct JSON Payload
- Ensure that the JSON data sent in the request body matches the expected structure for F5 APIs.
- Avoid embedding query parameters in the URL; use a proper JSON payload.

### 2. Secure Credentials
- Use environment variables or a secure credential management tool to store `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`.

### 3. Remove `eval`
- Directly execute the `curl` command instead of wrapping it with `eval`.

### 4. Improve Error Handling
- Use `curl` flags like `--fail`, `--silent`, and `--show-error` to provide clearer feedback on API call outcomes.

### 5. Enhance Readability
- Fix typos in comments and improve formatting for better maintainability.

## Updated Script
The script was rewritten to address these issues. Below is the updated version:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# F5 API endpoint and credentials
F5_URL="https://f5-big-ip.yourloadbalancer.com/mgmt/tm/ltm/data-group/internal/NameYourDatagroup"
USERNAME=""  # Replace with your username
PASSWORD=""  # Replace with your password

# Function to add a record
add_record() {
    local ip="$1"
    local value="$2"

    curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" \
        -d "{\"records\": [{\"name\": \"$ip\", \"data\": \"$value\"}]}" \
        "$F5_URL" \
        --fail --silent --show-error

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Record $ip:$value added successfully."
    else
        echo "Failed to add record $ip:$value."
    fi
}

# Function to delete a record
delete_record() {
    local ip="$1"

    curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" \
        -d "{\"records\": [{\"name\": \"$ip\"}]}" \
        "$F5_URL" \
        --fail --silent --show-error

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Record $ip deleted successfully."
    else
        echo "Failed to delete record $ip."
    fi
}

# Main script logic
if [ "$1" == "add" ]; then
    if [ -z "$2" ] || [ -z "$3" ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 add <IP-address> <Value>"
        exit 1
    fi
    add_record "$2" "$3"
elif [ "$1" == "del" ]; then
    if [ -z "$2" ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 del <IP-address>"
        exit 1
    fi
    delete_record "$2"
else
    echo "Usage: $0 {add|del} <IP-address> [Value]"
    exit 1
fi
